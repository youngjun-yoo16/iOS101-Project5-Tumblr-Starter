# Project 5 - *Tumblr Feed*

Submitted by: **Youngjun Yoo**

**Tumblr Feed** is an app that displays a list of Tumblr blog posts in a scrolling list. It demonstrates creating and configuring a table view and a custom table view cell, along with fetching data from an API. The project emphasizes UI setup, including table views and custom cells, and dynamically loading images and text from the Tumblr API into the app. It's a practical exercise in applying API data fetching and UI elements in iOS development. 

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- ✅ App has a configured table view and table view call
- ✅ App populates the table view with data fetched from an API


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- ✅ App has a refresh control to update the table view

## Video Walkthrough


## Notes

Understanding and implementing network requests to fetch data from the Tumblr API was a bit complex. Moreover, unwraping the optional photo path and using the Nuke library's load image function to asynchronously fetch and load the image from the image URL required some effort for understading the code.
